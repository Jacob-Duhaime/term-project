<h1>What is 'Trie'?</h1>

<p> Trie (pronounced <b>“Try”</b>, comes from the word <b>“retrieval”</b>) is a k-ary search tree data structure that is used for sophisticated types of data, such as strings. In this data structure, the links between the nodes are defined by individual characters from a string in which every child node is associated with its parent node. With Trie, you can do operations such as insertion, deletion and searching. A simplest way to explain this data structure is as an array of pointers to other nodes. Please look at the example below: </p>
